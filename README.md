# KomaruBot
Twitch Bot for guessing Ceres times for Super Metroid speedruns.



Currently hooked up with StreamElements for tracking points. 

Allows for the following:

* Starting/Stopping/Resetting Ceres
* Guessing Ceres Times
* Awarding points in StreamElements based on closeness to actual time
* Awarding points in StreamElements to all who guessed if the time is a configurable "Magic Time"
* Gambling points in StreamElements
* Komaru's Secret Backdoor Command
